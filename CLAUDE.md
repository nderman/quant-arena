# Quant Farm — Claude Code Instructions

## What This Is
Evolutionary arena for Polymarket 5M crypto binary markets. AI-bred engines compete in 1-hour rounds with a high-fidelity referee: dual orderbooks, quartic fees, latency, toxic flow, fill decay, oracle noise, and on-chain merge latency.

**Multi-coin:** BTC, ETH, SOL each run their own arena + breeder process. Telegram is shared.

## Scripts catalog
**Before writing any one-off analysis script, check `scripts/README.md`.** It indexes every script with purpose, args, status, and known issues. Update it in the same PR when you add or change a script.

## Key Commands
- `npm run arena:dry` — simulated data, no APIs
- `npm run arena:live` — live PM + Binance data (auto-discovers markets)
- `npm run arena:1round:dry` — quick test (1 min round)
- `npm run test:unit` — 255 tests, must all pass
- `python3 scripts/auto_rotate.py` — dry-run engine roster selection (prints ranked candidates + diff). Add `--commit` to actually swap.
- `python3 scripts/livePnLByEngine.py` — per-engine PnL from data/live_trades.jsonl (FILL+SETTLE ledger). Add `--since 24h` for window.
- `python3 scripts/backfillLiveLedger.py --reset --write` — rebuild ledger from Polymarket Activity API + ROSTER_HISTORY (script-internal).
- `python3 scripts/syncManualTrades.py --write` — incrementally sync recent Activity API events into the ledger. Catches manual UI buys/sells + any forward-emit gaps. Wired on VPS as `*/10 * * * *`.

## Known operational issue: phantom-position silence

If wide variant (or any engine using `if (positions > 0) skip` self-gating) goes silent for >12h on a 4h arena, suspect **phantom positions stuck in liveArena state** because `pollLiveSettlements` is failing on Gamma API errors (returns HTML instead of JSON when rate-limited). The May 5 rehydration fix (arena-keyed settled tracking) handles this on RESTART but not at runtime.

Workaround: `pm2 restart quant-arena-<arena>`. Rehydration will skip settled tokens correctly.

Real fix pending (task #93): make liveSettlement use the local ledger's SETTLE rows as auth source for "this position is settled" instead of (or in addition to) Gamma polling.

Diagnostic (the lesson from May 4 — always check first, don't assume regime):
```bash
ssh root@VPS 'pm2 logs quant-arena-<arena> --lines 5000 --nostream --raw 2>&1 | grep -E "live snapshot|wide-v1: cash=.* positions="'
```
If `positions=N` for N>0 with no recent SETTLE → phantom. Restart unblocks.

## Safety Nets
- **Portfolio halt watcher** (`scripts/portfolioHaltWatcher.py`, cron `*/5 * * * *`): sums realized P&L from `data/live_trades.jsonl` over rolling `PORTFOLIO_HALT_LOOKBACK_HOURS` (default 12h). If loss exceeds `PORTFOLIO_HALT_LOSS_USD` (default $25), touches `data/live_halt.flag`. User must manually `rm` the flag to resume. Built after May 2 2026 incident (-$52 in 24h with no system-level circuit breaker).
- **Streak cull in auto_rotate**: any incumbent live engine with `STREAK_CULL_LOOKBACK` (default 5) consecutive sim losses gets auto-removed + 6h cooldown, regardless of aggregate sharpe. Prevents incumbent_bonus from holding declining engines.
- **Live halt flag** (`data/live_halt.flag`): if exists, liveArena/liveExecutor refuse new orders. Manual: `touch ~/quant-arena/data/live_halt.flag`.
- **Flat $$ ceiling on per-trade size** (`MAX_LIVE_TRADE_USD`, default $8): per-order USD capped at `min(bankroll × MAX_POSITION_PCT, MAX_LIVE_TRADE_USD)`. Prevents adverse-fill selection (polymarket-ai-bot lesson: stakes >$10 drop WR 75%→40%). Scale horizontally (more engines, more arenas) instead of vertically (bigger trades).
- **Trial gate on engine promotions** (`auto_rotate.py`, May 6): new engines run at `TRIAL_BANKROLL_USD` (default $5) for first `TRIAL_FIRE_COUNT` (default 5) settled live fires. After N: promote to full bankroll if net positive realized PnL, drop from candidates if net negative. Catches sim:live divergence at -$3 instead of -$13 like chop-fader did.
- **Engine-class haircut on auto_rotate scoring** (`auto_rotate.py CLASS_HAIRCUTS`, May 6): sim Sharpe multiplied by class confidence (1.0 momentum-settle, 0.6 vol-regime-gate / mid-price-hold, 0.3 maker-stack, 0.0 chop-fader). Live-validated engines (5+ positive settles) override class default with 1.0. Belt-and-braces with the `config/sim_unreliable.json` blacklist.
- **Ledger fallback for live settlement** (`liveSettlement.ts applyLedgerSettlements`, May 6): when Gamma API fails (returns HTML), pollLiveSettlements scans local `data/live_trades.jsonl` SETTLE rows to clear positions. Fixes the chronic phantom-position freeze where Gamma rate-limits → settlements never process → engine self-gates → silence.

## Auto-Rotation
Hourly cron on VPS at :05 runs `auto_rotate.py --commit`. Picks top SAFE engines by `recent_sharpe × regime_fit × incumbent_bonus × live_pnl_penalty` (compound penalty floored at 0.5×). Writes `data/live_engines.json`; `liveArena.ts` fs.watch picks up the new roster within 30s, no PM2 restart.

Manual override paths:
- Edit `data/live_engines.json` directly — file-watcher reloads, cron respects via auto-detected manual-cull cooldown.
- Touch `data/auto_rotation.disabled` — cron exits early.
- Edit `config/sim_unreliable.json` — `(engine, arena)` blacklist for engines whose sim score is known not to translate to live (e.g. extreme-price entries before May 2026 referee patch). Auto-rotate excludes from candidate pool. Versioned in git (unlike `data/` which is runtime-only).
- See `data/auto_rotation.log` for hourly decisions, `data/auto_rotation_cooldown.json` for active cooldowns.

`bankrollUsd` per engine is the **sizing basis** (scales sim positions to live), NOT a wallet allocation. All engines share the single PM funder wallet. Bump per-engine `bankrollUsd` when the wallet tops up.

## Live ledger
`data/live_trades.jsonl` — append-only log of FILL + SETTLE events tagged with engineId. `src/live/liveLedger.ts` exports `recordFill` (called from liveExecutor + liveReconcile), `recordSettle` (liveSettlement), and `rehydratePositionsFromLedger` (called from liveArena startup to restore in-memory positions across PM2 restarts — closes the chronic double-buy bug). All wire-points pass `coin` + `arenaInstanceId` from liveArena.

Read: `scripts/livePnLByEngine.py`. Historical backfill: `scripts/backfillLiveLedger.py`. Continuous sync (every 10 min, catches manual UI trades + emit gaps): `scripts/syncManualTrades.py` (cron). Dedup uses (slug, side, size, price) fingerprint since forward `clientOrderId` ≠ Activity API `transactionHash`.

## Dual Orderbook Model (Critical)
UP and DOWN tokens have **independent orderbooks**. UP + DOWN ≠ $1.00.
The gap is where merge arb profit lives. The referee uses each token's real book — no price inversion.

## The Fee Model (Quartic, Apr 2026)
```
fee = amount × 0.25 × (P × (1 − P))²
```
- At P=0.50: 1.56% (maximum — kills most edges)
- At P=0.80: 0.64% (manageable)
- At P=0.90: 0.20% (edge trading sweet spot)
- At P=0.99: 0.003% (near zero)
- **MERGE: Flavor A only.** Engine must already hold BOTH sides of the same conditional pair before calling MERGE — referee burns both legs and credits $1/pair. Flavor B (buy opposite + merge atomically) was removed because it kept producing exploit paths. To emulate B, emit BUY for the opposite then MERGE on a subsequent tick.
- Makers: 0% fee + 20% rebate of taker fees, 5bps adverse selection. **Post-Only enforced**: maker BUY rejects if `action.price >= bestAsk`; maker SELL rejects if `action.price <= bestBid`. All maker orders go straight to GTC FIFO queue (no instant-fill lottery).
- **GTC FIFO virtual queue**: Orders track `sharesAhead` (book depth at/above limit price on entry). Each tick: depth decreases advance queue by 50% (can't distinguish fills from cancellations), depth increases push us back (price jumpers). Order only fills when `sharesAhead <= 0`. At 5¢ with 10k shares queued, you wait until queue clears. At 50¢ with thin books, fills are fast.
- Tick size: $0.001, Latency: 50ms (realistic API lag, no artificial delay)
- **Limit price enforcement**: `action.price` is the engine's max-acceptable BUY (or min-acceptable SELL). walkBook rejects fills that would breach the limit. No more "submit at $0.10, fill at $0.83" silent market-order behavior.
- **Per-tick book snapshots:** referee eagerly clones UP+DOWN books at snapshot creation (not lazy). Engines processed in the same tick share depletion (no ghost liquidity) and see the same moment-in-time state.
- **walkBook validity guards** (via `isBookTradeable()`): rejects walks where best bid >= best ask (crossed book), best prices outside [`PM_PRICE_MIN`, `PM_PRICE_MAX`] inclusive (default 0.005-0.995), bid-ask spread > `PM_BOOK_MAX_SPREAD` (default $0.50), one-sided book, or stale book (> `PM_BOOK_STALE_MS`, default 30s). Engines can call `isBookTradeable(book)` directly to pre-check.
- **Ingestion-time PM book filtering** (`parsePmL2` + `isBookUpdateReasonable` in pulse.ts): drops invalid levels, rejects crossed books at parse time, filters transient quotes where best price jumps > `PM_BOOK_MAX_JUMP_FRACTION` (default 25%) in a single update. Catches PM's occasional bad/transient WS messages before they pollute our books.
- **Dual-book consistency check**: BUY/SELL actions reject when `thisToken_ask + oppositeToken_ask < CONFIG.DUAL_BOOK_MIN_SUM` (default $0.85). Real PM keeps the sum near $1.00; impossibly cheap sums indicate stale/corrupt book data on one side.
- **Snipe-stale-makers cancellation model**: taker BUY/SELL rejects with probability scaling on Binance momentum when the local PM book is stale relative to a recent move. Models real-world MM cancellation latency (~30-50ms). At default 5bps cumulative momentum over 5s + 100ms book staleness, rejection prob is ~50%; 10bps → ~95%. Configurable via `SNIPE_*` env vars.
- **Extreme-price adverse selection (May 2026, two layers)**:
  - **Layer 1 (fill cost)** in `simulateToxicFlow` (`referee.ts`): at `|fillPrice - 0.5| > EXTREME_PRICE_THRESHOLD` (0.30), amplifies toxic prob (+ up to `EXTREME_PRICE_ADVERSE_PROB_BOOST_MAX` = 0.65) and bps magnitude (up to 2x). Knobs: `EXTREME_PRICE_ENABLED` (true), `EXTREME_PRICE_EXTRA_ADVERSE_BPS` (30).
  - **Layer 2 (settlement bias)** in `pollAndSettle` (`settlement.ts`, sim only — `liveSettlement.ts` unaffected): at settle time, if `pos.avgEntry` is extreme, with probability `extremity × EXTREME_SETTLEMENT_BIAS_PROB_MAX` (0.40 default), force a winning candle to resolve as a loss. Models the empirical mechanism that depth at extreme prices is informed flow. Knob: `EXTREME_SETTLEMENT_BIAS_ENABLED` (true).
  - Calibration: chop-fader-v1 sim:live gap was -$22/fire (sim too optimistic). Layer 1 alone closes ~$0.01. Layer 2 closes another ~$0.61 (at default prob 0.40) up to ~$1.47 (at prob 1.0). Remaining gap is unmodeled — likely position-size effects in live. **The `config/sim_unreliable.json` blacklist remains the primary defense for extreme-price strategies until a more complete model lands.**
- **Settlement** writes a `SETTLE` row to the trades table with the true payout pnl, so `SUM(pnl)` is honest
- **Phantom alpha detector**: arena.runRound flags any engine with > $500 single-round PnL (impossible from $50 starting cash) as a likely sim bug.

## Rules
- Use `updatePendingOrders()` / `hasPendingOrder()` / `markPending()` for fill-latency race protection (prevents pyramiding during 50ms fill window). Returns true on market rotation.
- Every engine must call `feeAdjustedEdge()` before trading
- Never trade at mid-prices without > 2% raw edge
- Use `cheapestExit(price, shares, tokenId)` to compare SELL vs MERGE with real book prices
- TokenId must match active market (referee rejects fabricated tokens)
- Must hold ≥ 5 shares to sell (CLOB), ≥ 1 share to merge (on-chain)
- Engines auto-load from `src/engines/` — just extend `AbstractEngine`
- Tests must pass before any deploy: `npm run test:unit`

## Deploy
```bash
bash scripts/deploy.sh           # full deploy: rsync, rebuild, PM2 restart (kills in-flight rounds)
bash scripts/deploy-engines.sh   # surgical: rsync only src/engines/, no PM2 restart
bash scripts/deploy-engines.sh btc  # only one coin
```
- VPS: 165.232.84.91 (DigitalOcean)
- PM2 processes (7 total): `quant-arena-{btc,eth,sol}`, `quant-breeder-{btc,eth,sol}`, `quant-telegram`
- Deploy excludes BredEngine_* files and `data/` (preserved on VPS)
- **Use deploy-engines.sh for hand-built engine adds/edits/deletes** — it touches a per-coin reload flag that arena.ts picks up at the next round boundary, swapping the engine roster without disrupting the round. Position state lives per-round in EngineState so swapping instances is safe.
- **Use full deploy.sh** for arena.ts / referee.ts / pulse.ts changes — those don't go through the require-cache reload path and need a real restart.

## Config
All via environment variables. Key:
`PEAK_FEE_RATE`, `LATENCY_MS`, `TOXIC_FLOW_ENABLED`, `PM_CONDITION_ID`, `BINANCE_SYMBOL`,
`GAS_COST_USD`, `GAS_VOL_MULTIPLIER`, `ORACLE_NOISE_BPS`, `MAKER_FILL_PROBABILITY`,
`ARENA_COIN` (per-process), `ARENA_INSTANCE_ID`, `BREED_INTERVAL_HOURS`, `MIN_NEW_ROUNDS_TO_BREED`, `CODER_MODEL`.

## Breeder
- Default `CODER_MODEL=anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` (cheap; override to `claude-sonnet-4-5` for richer codegen)
- Loop cadence: 6h per coin (`BREED_INTERVAL_HOURS`)
- Data gate: skip cycle unless `MIN_NEW_ROUNDS_TO_BREED` (default 3) new rounds since last successful breed
- Bred engines load on next natural arena restart (breeder no longer auto-restarts pm2)
